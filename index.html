                Amazon
                Ebay
            </ul>
            <p> You can find guitars at any of these locations listed above. I recommend doing research online before
                purchasing a guitar through amazon or ebay. However if you want more human intearction
                and a more in depth of understading of guitar's, I would highly recommend your local guitar shop or
                Guitar for your musical needs</p>

            <li>Yamaha pacifica 112v
                Squire Bullet Mustang
                Epiphone Les Paul Studio
            </li>
            <p> Here are some great beginner guitars if you are new on your musical journey and you can't pi point what you want. This is a good start, guitar shopping can be 
                intimidating and there is a bunch of articles online that can be misleading. This makes it easier to browse the limited options provided and takes the anxiety
                away from walking into your local guitar shop and having no clue as to where to start.

            <p>Yamaha pacifica 112v has been ranked the best beginner guitar. It is light weight, and has a clean sound.</p>
